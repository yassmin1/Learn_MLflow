    "✅ **Module 3.5: CI/CD Automation with MLflow** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Learning Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ **Automate Retraining by Monitoring Parameter Files (e.g., params.yaml)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it means:**\n",
    "  Automatically starting a new training run whenever your model parameters or hyperparameters are updated. Parameters are usually saved in a simple configuration file like `params.yaml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Detailed Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Keep parameters (like `alpha`, `learning_rate`, or number of iterations) in a separate file (`params.yaml`).\n",
    "  * Set up an automation system to detect changes to this file.\n",
    "  * Trigger automatic model retraining when parameter updates occur, ensuring the latest configurations are always used.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why it matters:**\n",
    "  This automation ensures consistency and removes manual intervention, reducing mistakes and making experimentation and deployment faster and smoother.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ **Simulate CI/CD Triggers (e.g., via GitHub Actions)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it means:**\n",
    "  Automatically triggering actions (like model retraining or testing) whenever certain conditions are met—like pushing code changes to GitHub or updating parameter files.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Detailed Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Set up GitHub Actions to monitor changes in your repository.\n",
    "  * Define specific triggers (e.g., file changes, commits, or merges):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```yaml\n",
    "    on:\n",
    "      push:\n",
    "        paths:\n",
    "          - 'config/params.yaml'\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * Automate tasks like installing dependencies, retraining models, logging results, and more upon trigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why it matters:**\n",
    "  It enables automation and rapid iteration, significantly improving development workflow efficiency, reproducibility, and collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ **Structure Training Scripts to be Triggered Programmatically**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it means:**\n",
    "  Organizing your training scripts clearly, so they can be automatically executed by automation systems without manual intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Detailed Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Write a `train.py` script that reads parameters from a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import yaml\n",
    "    import mlflow\n",
    "\n",
    "    with open(\"config/params.yaml\") as f:\n",
    "        params = yaml.safe_load(f)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # use params in training\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * Ensure the script is self-contained—loading data, training the model, logging metrics and models to MLflow automatically when executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why it matters:**\n",
    "  Clear, structured scripts simplify integration into automated workflows, improving maintainability and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ **Log Updated Models to MLflow from Automation Pipelines**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it means:**\n",
    "  Automatically recording every training run and its results (parameters, metrics, artifacts) in MLflow whenever automation triggers model retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Detailed Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * In your automated `train.py` script, add MLflow logging:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import mlflow\n",
    "    mlflow.set_experiment(\"cicd-automation\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    with mlflow.start_run():\n",
    "        mlflow.log_param(\"alpha\", params[\"alpha\"])\n",
    "        mlflow.log_metric(\"accuracy\", accuracy)\n",
    "        mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, \"model\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * Every triggered run automatically logs its details to MLflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why it matters:**\n",
    "  Provides a complete history of your models, allowing easy comparison and tracking. Enhances reproducibility and auditability of your model development process.\n"
