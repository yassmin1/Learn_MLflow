    "## 🎯 **Learning Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ **Log a Model with MLflow for Serving**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it means:**\n",
    "  Logging a model with MLflow means saving your trained model in a standardized format, making it ready to deploy or share with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Detailed Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Train your machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).\n",
    "  * Use MLflow functions like `mlflow.sklearn.log_model()` to store the model, parameters, and metadata.\n",
    "  * MLflow stores this information so it can later serve the model or load it for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why it matters:**\n",
    "  Logging ensures your model is reproducible, organized, versioned, and easily retrievable for serving.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ **Serve the Model Using `mlflow models serve`**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it means:**\n",
    "  Serving means deploying your logged model on a server, turning it into a RESTful API that accepts prediction requests and sends back predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Detailed Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * After logging the model, run the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    mlflow models serve -m runs:/<RUN_ID>/model_name -p 5001 --no-conda\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * `runs:/<RUN_ID>/model_name` specifies the model you want to serve.\n",
    "  * `-p 5001` indicates the port number your API listens to.\n",
    "  * `--no-conda` means it uses the current Python environment instead of creating a new Conda environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why it matters:**\n",
    "  Serving models through a REST API allows easy integration with web apps, mobile apps, and other software, enabling real-time predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ **Send REST API Requests with JSON Payload**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it means:**\n",
    "  Once your model is served, it expects data for predictions. REST API requests are how you send this data (input features) to your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Detailed Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Create input data as JSON (usually from a pandas DataFrame or Python dictionary):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import requests\n",
    "    import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "    url = \"http://127.0.0.1:5001/invocations\"\n",
    "    data = pd.DataFrame({\"feature1\": [0.5], \"feature2\": [1.5]}).to_json(orient=\"records\")\n",
    "    headers = {\"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "    response = requests.post(url, data=data, headers=headers)\n",
    "    print(response.json())\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * Use `requests.post()` to send the data to the model endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why it matters:**\n",
    "  JSON payloads are a universal way to send structured data over the web. Using JSON ensures your API can easily communicate with various software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ **Interpret API Response from `/invocations` Endpoint**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it means:**\n",
    "  The `/invocations` endpoint is where the REST API serves predictions. The response usually includes predictions made by the model based on the input provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Detailed Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * When you send data to `/invocations`, the API returns predictions as JSON. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```json\n",
    "    [20.3]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Or for classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```json\n",
    "    {\"predicted_label\": 1, \"probability\": 0.85}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * Your application interprets this response (e.g., showing predictions to users or making automated decisions).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why it matters:**\n",
    "  Clearly interpreting API responses allows your applications or workflows to make accurate and informed decisions based on real-time model predictions.\n",
    "\n"
